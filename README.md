# Live Todo

A multi-user live to-do list using socket.io. Responsive, clean, and easy to use!

## Goals

The goals of this project were:

- [x] TODO notes can be created, completed, edited, and deleted.
- [x] TODO notes should appear identically on all clients.
- [x] Mark all TODOs as complete.
- [x] Option to delete all TODOs.
- [x] Clean, minimal, responsive styling.
- [ ] Option to manually toggle between light and dark modes.
- [x] System synced dark mode.
- [x] Generally bug free.
- [x] Should treat different browser windows as different clients/users.
- [x] Cache data so TODOs are kept when connection is borked.
- [ ] Notify when disconnected.
- [ ] Deploy app.

## Set Up

This is a Node app so you'll need Node and NPM to get it up on its feet.

```bash
npm i && npm start
```

App will be live on:

```bash
http://localhost:3003/
```

Navigate in two browsers, or one browser in regular and private/incognito windows to test as two users.

## Enjoy

This was a phenomenally fun little sockets project!
